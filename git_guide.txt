Step 1: Executing "git init" creates a .git subdirectory in the current working directory

Step 2: Add modified files to the staging area:(e.g, if gem.F90 is modified ingemx_scott_1018), the following command could be used (under the GEMX directory): "git add gemx_scott_1018"

Step 4: Push the commit to a remote repository: git push origin branch-name
